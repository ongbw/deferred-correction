Deferred correction is a well-established method for incrementally
increasing the order of accuracy of a numerical solution to a set of
ordinary differential equations. Because implementations of deferred
corrections can be pipelined, multi-core computing has increased the
importance of deferred correction methods in practice, especially in
the context of solving initial-value problems. This repository
contains lightweight, flexible MATLAB software to explore variants of
deferred correction methods described in the review article: "Deferred
Correction Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations"
